# Fantasy Football Scoreboard App
### A Town, A Team, and No Dream 
My fantasy football league faces a unique problem: the scoring methodologies offered through ESPN's fantasy app are simply not good enough for us. 
Do they suffice for 99.99% of fantasy football newbies & enthusiasts alike? Yes. Do they suffice for us? Absolutely 100% No. 

### 9 teams, 1 problem
The issue, *nay* the catastrophe arose when our league went from 10 teams to 9. The trad'l matchup model left an odd man out each week, which seemed like a waste of everyone's time. A bye week is helpful when you're managing *real* NFL football players, but yields no such benefit to the fantasy manager. 

### A scoreboard for the rest of us
The solution to this problem was a scoring methodology in which the entire league competes against itself each week. The fruit of your efforts is a weekly score corresponding to the inverse of your rank that week. For example, in our assymetrical 9-team league, the team with the highest team score gets 9 points as their plunder; the lowest gets 1 point, etc.
