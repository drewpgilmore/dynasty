# Fantasy Football Scoreboard App
##### A scoreboard for the rest of us
My fantasy football league faces a unique and confusing problem: the scoring methodologies offered through ESPN's fantasy app are simply not good enough for us. 
Do they suffice for 99.99% of fantasy football newbies & enthusiasts alike? Yes. Do they suffice for us? Absolutely 100% No. 

##### 9 teams, 1 problem
The issue, *nay* the catastrophe arose when our league went from 10 teams to 9. The trad'l matchup model left an odd man out each week, which seemed like a waste of everyone's time. A bye week is helpful when you're managing *real* NFL football players, but yields no such benefit to the fantasy manager.
